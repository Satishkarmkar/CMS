            <span>Writing content for school and college websites and other educational institutions is a bit different from writing content for general businesses. Although various educational institutions want to attract students, they cannot indulge in hard selling. It needs to be communicated subtly to students and their parents and guardians why they should attend this premier institute and not another institute.
                Through our content writers, Credible Content can provide you content for your website on one-time basis as well as ongoing basis. Since most of the schools and colleges these days are competing with each other, they need to be able to draw prospective students, parents and guardians and teaches to their websites on an ongoing basis, and especially when there is time to seek admissions. Through your content you need to convey why yours is a better place.</span>

            <span>Why Oxford and not Cambridge?
                Some schools and colleges also attract students from other universities. So, they also need to have content on their websites that conveys to international students that they are welcome and what educational and residential facilities are available at your school or college. And of course, the faculty. Regrettably, on most of the school and college websites it has been observed that less stress is given to the faculty whereas, the faculty is the most important aspect of any school or college. Through our content writing we always suggest that highlight the pool of educational talent that is present at your institution.
                Coming back to the content part, our content writers can provide you one-time content writing service as well as ongoing service. Many institutions prefer ongoing service because they continuously want to publish highly useful and scholarly content on their websites to draw students and parents. For that, many school and college websites these days have dedicated blogs and FAQ sections that are regularly updated.</span>
